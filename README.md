# A Christmas Present for a Loved One!

Quarantine has changed a lot of things, and this year, gift-giving was a bit different, too!
I decided to code my boyfriend a website with some mini-games and memories of our past
Christmases for the holidays. (He had a chance to win actual presents!) ♥︎

Had to put this on GitHub, so I could have a place to host it!
